### Track an organization's members and subscription payments

Originally built with CodeIgniter, I was recently inspired to rebuild this app as a learning experience. 

I watched Adam Wathan's excellent 'Chasing "Perfect"' at Laracon EU 2015. 

The simplicity of his approach to program design and testing struck a chord with me. I then sat down and tried a similar approach to the design of this rebuild. 

### Roadmap 

Figure out business logic of how members join and pay for their subscription. 

Model the business logic in code and the database. 

Create forms and controllers. Integrate with the app model. 

User Authentication, and a nice Bootstrap admin theme. 

Front End bells and whistles: pie charts, reports etc.
